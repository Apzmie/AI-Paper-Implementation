# AI-Paper-Implementation

This is my journey into the artificial intelligence world to be a professional.

It is just like my note-taking to understand the theoretical principles such as mathematics, not a fully completed code.

The key parts are mostly implemented, not all parts of the paper.

Codes are created with Chatgpt's help.
